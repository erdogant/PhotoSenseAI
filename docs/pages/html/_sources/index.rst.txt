**Welcome to the PhotoSense** â€“ your solution for organizing your photo collections with ease using Artificial Intelligence (AI)! Nowadays we can have hundreds or even thousands of digital memories but this often leads to chaos and time-consuming work to organize the photos. At some point, we may even dump all photos in a "various" directory and then these memories can be hard to find. This tool is designed to bring order to your chaos.


.. note::

	* Automatic Clustering: Group photos by date, location, or visual content using advanced techniques.
	* Custom Labels: Rename groups, adjust categories, and organize your images in a way that makes sense to you.
	* Dynamic Thumbnails: Choose the size of your thumbnails for a customized viewing experience.
	* Map Visualization: View your photos on an interactive map to see where your memories were captured.
