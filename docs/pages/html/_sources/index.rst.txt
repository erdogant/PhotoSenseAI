**Welcome to the PhotoSense** – your solution for organizing your photo collections with ease using Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Nowadays we have thousands of digital memories which often leads to chaos in finding and organizing photos. At some point, we may even dump all pictures in a “various” directory and then leave it for what it is. This tool is designed to bring order to your chaos!


.. note::

	* Automatic Clustering: Group photos by date, location, or visual content using advanced techniques.
	* Privacy: This tool runs offline and locally.
	* Custom Labels: Rename groups, adjust categories, and organize your images in a way that makes sense to you.
	* Dynamic Thumbnails: Choose the size of your thumbnails for a customized viewing experience.
	* Map Visualization: View your photos on an interactive map to see where your memories were captured.
	* There are **no costs** in using this app but a **coffee donation** will make you feel better! I like coffee!
