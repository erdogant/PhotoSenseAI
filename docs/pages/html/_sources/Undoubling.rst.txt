Detection of Duplicates
########################

Searching for (near-)identical photos on your system can be a tedious effort because you need to click through your entire system,
containing likely thousands of photos, and then decide for each photo whether it is a "similar" one.
The most straightforward approach to detect identical photos would be based on file size or filename.

However, photos are usually derived from different sources such as mobile devices and social media apps, which leads to differences in file size, name,
resolution, scaling, compression, and brightness.

With PhotoSense AI, you can now easily detect images that are identical or highly similar.
